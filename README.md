## About
In this unit we are starting off with what it means to be a programmatic thinker. We will also touch on the book at the end that has help numerous developers become effective problem solvers.

## Think Like A Programmer: Programmatic Thinking
Most people believe it takes a genius to be a software engineer, but this cannot be further from the truth. Coding is all about practice, repetition, and programmatic thinking. The expression "Think Like A Programmer" is a common phrase in the technology industry, ultimately stemming from the widely renowned book of the same name. Programmatic thinking is more of a modern way of saying computational thinking, lets dive a bit deeper.

### Computational Thinking
Computational thinking essentially is what one would say comes before programming/coding. This is taking any problem and/or scenario and breaking it down step by step for a computer to interpret successfully. The reason for this is that computers are very literally when it comes to instruction and steps need to be precise and detailed, many actions that we as human beings may take for granted.

**EXAMPLE**
For example, something such as washing your hands may sounds like a simple enough task, but in reality this involves quite a few steps. First, you’ll need a soap and water, second you’ll need a sink with warm water. Next you'll need to put soap on your hands. You will also need to turn the water on, place your hand under the water, and then add the soap to your hands etc. When we break down this simple everyday activity of washing our hands, you can see it involves many steps. In a very similar way to programming, missing a step or having the incorrect order of things could make for a difficult time in your program.

#### Computational Thinking: Key Components

There are several key skills of computational thinking:

- ***Fragmentation:*** Essentially fragmenting means to break into smaller pieces or divide into parts, similar to programming. This part of programming calls for breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. 
  
- ***Pattern Recognition/Application:*** This aspect is self explanatory, looking for similarities in the problem at hand to where you can assess if solutions of past problems can be utilized to solve the task at hand. This calls for a bit of repetition and being familiar with certain "trends" you may encounter in programming. A perfect example would be if you needed to build a chair, well the first chair may be the hardest to make but when you get to the second, third, fourth chair, you'll find its a matter of "rinse and repeat" which is what you will run into in the world of programming.
  
- ***Detail Orientation:*** In programming you'll find it would help a great deal to be as meticulous as you can be. Being able to identify aspects that are relevant and irrelevant to the problem at hand can make for a long or short time when trying to find solutions. Programming is really similar to solving a puzzle, when doing so you'll need to be able to be think abstractly or "outside the box" rather, making sure to sort through the clutter to find and apply the right pieces to complete it.
  
- ***Blueprint/Pseudo Coding:*** A blueprint is creating and laying out design, steps, and rules needed to follow in order to achieve the outcome you want, this brings us to pseudo coding.
Explanation Below Per [G4G](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/):

  - **Pseudo code:** is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields. It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorithm. Simply, we can say that it’s the cooked up representation of an algorithm. Often at times, algorithms are represented with the help of pseudo codes as they can be interpreted by programmers no matter what their programming background or knowledge is. Pseudo code, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood by even a layman with some school level programming knowledge.
  
  - **Algorithm:** It’s an organized logical sequence of the actions or the approach towards a particular problem. A programmer implements an algorithm to solve a problem. Algorithms are expressed using natural verbal but somewhat technical annotations.
  
  - **Pseudo code:** It’s simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and informative text written in plain English. It has no syntax like any of the programming language and thus can’t be compiled or interpreted by the computer.
  
  - **Advantages of Pseudo Code**
      - Improves the readability of any approach. It’s one of the best approaches to start implementation of an algorithm.
      - Acts as a bridge between the program and the algorithm or flowchart. Also works as a rough documentation, so the program of one developer can be understood easily when a pseudo code is written out. In industries, the approach of documentation is essential. And that’s where a pseudo-code proves vital.
      - The main goal of a pseudo code is to explain what exactly each line of a program should do, hence making the code construction phase easier for the programmer. 
  - **Disadvantages of Pseudo Code**
      - Pseudo Code  does not provide a visual representation of the logic of programming.
      - There are no proper format for writing the for Pseudo Code.
      - In Pseudo Code their is extra need of maintain documentation.
      - In Pseudo Code their is no proper standard very company follow their own standard for writing the Pseudo Code.

## Think Like A Programmer Book
Now that you have a foundational understanding of what programmatic thinking is, a good follow up would be to read the book posted below. This is a great first read and eye opener for any all developers, new and old, as it provides great context on programmatic thinking.You can find a free pdf version of it at this [link](http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/overviews/patterns/V_Anton_Spraul-Think_Like_a_Programmer-EN.pdf)

## Next Steps
Now that you are familiar with computational/programmatic thinking, the next step would be to understand problem solving and its importance in coding. Please click here to be directed to the [Problem Solving Module]()
